# Satellite Information App

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a029ac2-7f70-46b3-964a-d186ea849343

This app provides users with the ability to view satellite information. It allows access to satellite details and real-time tracking of satellite positions. Users can observe the active or inactive status of satellites, select a specific satellite for detailed information, and filter the list by searching for specific satellites.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: Displays a short animation when launching the app.
- **Onboarding Screen**: A three-step tutorial introducing the appâ€™s features.
  - **Step 1**: Quick access to the satellite list.
  - **Step 2**: Access to satellite details.
  - **Step 3**: Tracking satellite positions.
- **Satellite List Screen**: Displays a list of all satellites with active/inactive status indicators.
- **Search Feature**: Users can filter satellites by name in the list.
- **Satellite Detail Screen**: Shows detailed information about a selected satellite.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language.
- **Jetpack Hilt**: Used for dependency injection (DI).
- **Navigation Component**: Manages navigation between screens.
- **View Binding**: Provides safe and easy access to XML components.
- **Lottie**: Displays animations in the splash screen.
- **Room**: Used for local data storage of satellite details.
- **StateFlow**: Manages UI state within the application.

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles and has a modular structure. Each feature is organized as an independent module:

- **App Modules**:
  -  `app`: Serves as the entry point of the application and contains the application's configuration.

- **Data Modules**:
  - `data`: Contains data sources and repository structures.
  - `datasource`: Includes classes related to remote and local data sources.
  - `mapper`: Contains mapper classes that convert data models to UI models.
  - `repository`: Provides data and interacts with ViewModels through repository classes.
  - `room`: Contains Room structures for local database management.

- **Domain Modules**:
  - `domain`: Holds use cases and interfaces.
  - `model`: Contains models used in the UI.
  - `usecase`: Houses the necessary use cases for each business logic (e.g., fetching, searching, filtering).
  
- **Feature Modules**:
  - `onboarding`: Contains the onboarding screens that introduce the app to the user.
  - `satellites`: Contains the satellite list and search functionality.
  - `satellitedetail`: Contains the satellite detail screen.
  
- **Core Modules**:
  - `common`: Contains general-purpose utility classes, extension functions, and shared structures for the app.
 
- **Navigation Modules**:
  - `eyojnavigation`: Contains structures for managing navigation operations.

### Clean Architecture Layers

1. **Data Layer**: Manages API services, database operations, and data sources.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and Use Cases.
3. **UI Layer**: Holds ViewModels and UI components.

## Installation and Running the App

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
